## I've noted some rules to follow when you're coding and commiting on Github

- Use Yarn as Package manager insted on npm.
```
yarn start
yarn build
yarn test
yarn eject
```

- When commiting please write good commit message so everyone can understand. Also add your name before commit message
 - ~~this is commit~~ **Do _not_ do that**
 - name: updated readme file **Do this!**

- Some spacing tips while coding
```
~~if()~~ => if () ðŸ˜„
~~y=10~~ => y = 10 ðŸ˜€
```

- Also please DO NOT use this bracket syntax while creating a function
```
function demo()
{

}
```

- Use this syntax while creating a function
```
function demo() {

}
```
## Enjoy coding. Don't stress we will be okay.
